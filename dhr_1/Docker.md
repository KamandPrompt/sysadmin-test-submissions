I had never heard the name docker till now. So, I made a account on docker.com . 
I read a few online tutorials but things were not very clear. So i took help from this youtube video: https://youtu.be/JprTjTViaEA . 
This video helped me to understand the basics.
Because of this task, I am now familiar with Docker.
