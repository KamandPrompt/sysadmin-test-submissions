Problem 1: 

First task was to find subdomains of iitmandi.ac.in . So using the website pentest-tools.com . I got the following list:

Subdomain 						IP address 			Netname (whois) 	Country (whois) 
gateway.iitmandi.ac.in 			14.139.34.2 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
vpn.iitmandi.ac.in 				14.139.34.2 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
students.iitmandi.ac.in 		14.139.34.3 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
library.iitmandi.ac.in 			14.139.34.4 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
www.faculty.iitmandi.ac.in 		14.139.34.6 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
staff.iitmandi.ac.in 			14.139.34.6 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
faculty.iitmandi.ac.in 			14.139.34.6 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
se.iitmandi.ac.in 				14.139.34.8 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
projects.iitmandi.ac.in 		14.139.34.9 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
ncvpripg.iitmandi.ac.in 		14.139.34.10 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
www.rinai.iitmandi.ac.in 		14.139.34.10 		NKN-IIT-MANDI 		IN 	
localhost.iitmandi.ac.in 		127.0.0.1 			SPECIAL-IPV4-LOOPBACK-IANA-RESERVED 	US 	
webmail.iitmandi.ac.in 			204.197.248.190 	PRIVATE-TX-6 		US 	
ftp.iitmandi.ac.in 				204.197.248.190 	PRIVATE-TX-6 		US 	
iitmandi.ac.in 					204.197.248.190 	PRIVATE-TX-6 		US 	
www.iitmandi.ac.in 				204.197.248.190 	PRIVATE-TX-6 		US 	
mail.iitmandi.ac.in 			204.197.248.190 	PRIVATE-TX-6 		US	 	
cpanel.iitmandi.ac.in 			204.197.248.190 	PRIVATE-TX-6 	    US

I also found 2 other ip's:
    14.139.34.11
    14.139.34.17 uhl.iitmandi.ac.in

I already knew how to get all the open ports using nmap. So I used nmap. In nmap man page i found that i can also get os using nmap.
So, work done.

Problem 2:
    
ERNET is the official registrar for .ac.in domain names. Thus, iitmandi.ac.in was registered by IIT Mandi(address in the registration is of roorkee campus).
Ingormation here: https://www.whois.com/whois/iitmandi.ac.in .We can set up our own subdomains once we have a domain.
Source: https://www.quora.com/Do-you-have-to-purchase-a-sub-domain-if-you-already-have-the-domain 
Comment: IIT Mandi probably have to renew their domain by next year(Maximum lease period is 10 years).


Problem 3:

Duck Duck Go have only one datacenter(Gabriel Weinsberg's basement, not sure if i can call it a datacenter).
Duck Duck Go have their own servers and they also use Amazon EC2 servers. 
Source: https://duck.co/help/company/architecture
According to post(https://duck.co/redir/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhighscalability.com%2Fblog%2F2013%2F1%2F28%2Fduckduckgo-architecture-1-million-deep-searches-a-day-and-gr.html):
    
    "DuckDuckGo used to run out of Gabrielâ€™s basement. Most components, including all front-end components, are now on AWS." 
    Gabriel is founder and owner of DDG. 
    DDG is running in four AWS datacenters i.e. California, Virginia, Singapore, Ireland.
    Some components are still running from Gabriel Weinsberg's Basement.(like Git repository, crawling, and the real-time Wikipedia index that updates zero-click connects).

    So, DDG operates from 5 datacenters - 4 of AWS(California, Virginia, Singapore, Ireland) and Gabriel Weinsberg's Basement.
