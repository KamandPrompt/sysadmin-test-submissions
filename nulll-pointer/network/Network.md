# Task 1- OS fingerprinting

Almost all fingerprinting techniques are based on detecting difference in packets generated by different operating systems.

## How I did-
	I used nmap to find out the open ports and services running and the version of those services, then using ubuntu launchpad databse online(https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:6.6p1-2ubuntu1), i found out for which os, the openssh build and patch version were built(this could not give the information about all the systems.), we can also use nmap OS detection tool which guesses the possible operating systems.
	i have put up the nmap scan report in a seperate file named nmap_report.md

## Findings :

### For projects.iitmandi.ac.in (14.139.34.9)
 	Aggressive OS guesses: Linux 3.11 - 4.1 (93%), Linux 3.13 (89%), Linux 4.4 (87%), Linux 3.2 - 3.8 (87%), Linux 3.8 (87%), WatchGuard Fireware 11.8 (87%), Linux 3.16 (87%), IPFire 2.11 firewall (Linux 2.6.32) (87%), Linux 3.10 - 3.12 (86%), DD-WRT v24-sp1 (Linux 2.4) (86%)

### For 14.139.34.24
	Aggressive OS guesses: Microsoft Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2 (92%), Microsoft Windows Server 2012 (91%), Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 (89%), Microsoft Windows Vista SP0 or SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP1, or Windows 7 (86%), Microsoft Windows 7 Professional (86%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 (86%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 (85%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 (85%), Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 (85%), Microsoft Windows Server 2008 or 2008 Beta 3 (85%)

## Using OpenSSH Banner anatomy
### For 14.139.34.2
	Ubuntu 14.04
### For 14.139.34.4
	Ubuntu 14.04
### For students.iitmandi.ac.in
	Its ssh banner could not be found, but it uses Apache httpd 2.4.18 which was released in december 2015, it can be guessed that it uses ubuntu 12.04 or later.


# Task 2- Using DNS lookup service
## How i found 
	It could be found by using any whois lookup service, which search the registry for already registered domains.
## Findings
	iitmandi.ac.in is hosted at http://www.ernet.in/services.html
## Resource 
	http://whois.net/


# Task 3- Finding duckduckgo data centers.

### How i did
	We can use trace route tools to find out path of the packets in an ip network/or we can search google.

### Findings
	They use amazon servers(not data centers. More on this in the what i learnt section).
	Following was the result of a route trace -
	Connected to:  AMAZON.COM.edge1.Washington1.Level3.net ( 4.28.125.110 )
	Roundtrip times:  
		20.785 ms
		19.828 ms
		20.331 ms
	Country:  united states
	This can also be verified from the following link  - https://duck.co/help/company/architecture

# What i learnt -

### Server vs Datacenter
	A Server is on a single machine. It can only handle as much load as a single machine is capable of handling before performance degrades. If the machine goes down for any reason (for example, hardware failure, network fault, or planned maintenance), then server is unavailable to users for the downtime. 

	Data Center looks like a single instance of a server to users, but under the hood, it consists of a cluster of multiple machines ("cluster nodes") each running the server web application, behind a load balancer. This provides important benefits over a server:
    Performance at scale: A cluster of many machines running server can handle more load than a single machine.
    High availability: If one cluster node goes down, then the remaining cluster node(s) can continue servicing requests so users should see little or no loss of availability. 

### Little bit about OS fingerprinting
### Little bit about using nmap for services and port scanning
### Little bit about route tracing
