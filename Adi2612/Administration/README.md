  # the meaning of HUMAN_FRIENDLY SECURED is :-
     
     1. things can not be coppied or moved or removed from the COmputer.
     2. No one without any permission can read or write file.
     3. but the administrator does not required any coding skills to access that file.
     
  #  IDEA :---
  
    1. Create a Software which can only be run by administrative right.
    2. The first purpose of the software is that it create a file in background whose name will
       be random and that file can not be searched on the pc and can only be run by this application.
    3. The second purpose of this app is to connect with google sheet api , So when you write something 
        in this file it will be automatically saved in online google sheet
    4. But If you are not connected with internet then it will store the data somewhere So, that when you 
       connect with internet it will automatically first saved the data in google sheet.
